# Data Forge Daily

Data Forge Daily is a personal learning platform I created to support **focused, job-aligned learning for data engineering roles**.

Rather than jumping between disconnected tutorials, this project gives me a structured way to practice core data engineering concepts consistently, with an emphasis on *how data engineers actually think and work*.

## Why I Built This

As I prepare for a career in data engineering, I wanted a learning system that:

- Keeps my practice intentional and focused
- Reinforces fundamentals through repetition and hands-on work
- Encourages thinking in terms of pipelines, transformations, and structure
- Grows alongside my skills instead of being a one-off tutorial project

Data Forge Daily acts as both a **learning tool** and a **record of my progress** as I build toward a data engineering role.

## Learning Focus Areas

Current and planned learning areas include:

- Python fundamentals for data engineering
- Data manipulation and transformation logic
- PySpark and distributed data processing concepts
- ETL-style problem solving
- Structured lesson design using JSON-based modules

Lessons are intentionally broken into small, focused topics to encourage daily practice and steady improvement.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- JSON-based lesson modules

---

## Project Status

This project is actively evolving as my skills grow.  
New lessons, refinements, and structural improvements are added regularly as part of my ongoing data engineering learning journey.

## Goal

The long-term goal of Data Forge Daily is to:

- Build strong, practical foundations in data engineering
- Demonstrate consistent learning and problem-solving habits
- Serve as a portfolio project that reflects how I approach learning and system design
